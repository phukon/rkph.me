## Prologue

Ever dreamt of a React app that chuckles at bugs and scoffs at spaghetti code?
Let’s embark on a journey to create a React app so robust it could survive an
apocalypse of bad coding practices. <br/>

In those novice days, my code resembled a wild creature — functional, yet
utterly chaotic. The project structure, if you could call it that, was a
disorganized mess. It sufficed for my humble beginnings, **but as the project
grew, so did the complexity, and chaos ensued.**

With each expansion of the project, finding a specific piece of code became a
quest akin to searching for a needle in a haystack, only to realize that the
needle was a variable aptly named ‘needle’ buried somewhere deep in the code.

Take the time to learn how to structuring your React project before your
codebase transforms into an unsolvable mystery novel.

How a project should look like:

```bash
src
|
+-- assets
|
+-- components
|
+-- config
|
+-- features
|
+-- hooks
|
+-- lib
|
+-- providers
|
+-- routes
|
+-- stores
|
+-- test
|
+-- types
|
+-- utils
```

`componenets`: Shared components that grace the entire kingdom <br/> `config` :
The vault of global configurations, env variables, and secrets<br/> `features` :
Feature based modules<br/> `hooks` : Mystical hooks, shared across the entire
realm<br/> `libs` : re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the
application<br/> `providers` : Keepers of the application’s life force, the
providers<br/> `routes` : routes configuration<br/> `stores` : global state
stores<br/> `test` : The arena of trials, where utilities and mock servers prove
their mettle<br/> `types` : base types used across the application<br/> `utils`
: shared utility functions<br/>

---

Now, let’s descend into the heart of a feature.

src/features/my-new-feature

```bash
|
+-- api         # Declarations and API hooks, a symphony of requests for this feature
|
+-- assets      # Treasures specific to the awesome feature
|
+-- components  # Components, artisans sculpting the visual identity of the feature
|
+-- hooks       # Hooks, magical spells woven into the fabric of this feature
|
+-- routes      # Paths leading to the feature's pages, a roadmap of wonder
|
+-- stores      # Keepers of state, guarding the feature's sacred truths
|
+-- types       # TypeScript types, a lexicon for the feature's domain
|
+-- utils       # The craftsmen, building utility functions exclusive to this feature
|
+-- index.ts    # The grand entrance, the public API of this feature, revealing its essence
```

## The index file

Everything from a feature should be exported from the index.ts file which
behaves as the public API of the feature.

You should import stuff from other features only by using:

```javascript
import { AwesomeComponent } from "@/features/awesome-feature";
```

and not

```javascript
import {AwesomeComponent} from "@/features/awesome-feature/components/AwesomeComponent
```

## Set up absolute imports!

Absolute imports can make your import statements cleaner and more readable. They
also help in avoiding long relative import paths.

```javascript
//  jsconfig.json/tsconfig.json
"compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
```

Remember, every developer, seasoned or fledgling, has danced the maddening tango
with spaghetti code. But with structure comes clarity, and with clarity comes
the power to wield React with finesse.

So, as you forge your own path in the realms of frontend development, let this
blueprint be your guiding light, your treasure map to organized brilliance. May
your React projects chuckle at bugs, scoff at chaos, and stand firm in the face
of coding calamities.
