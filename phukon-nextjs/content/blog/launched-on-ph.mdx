I launched Clack on Product Hunt last week. It was scary tbh because although
I got everything straightened, it felt like a freaking big leap of faith to me.

There's always a feature you want to improve on, a design you wanna implement, this
kept me from launching for some time. Also I didn't know what a Product Hunt <i>hunter</i> was until after
the launch!

I've spent a lot of time on this one. The design went through multiple iterations. Countless hours were spent reading documentation to integrate Google and Notion with Clack.

I created product shots and shared them on Reddit and Discord communities.
Following that, I commenced writing my initial comment. This was my
opportunity to connect with potential users. All going well, it would
be read by several hundred people so I wrote a long one.

In hindsight, it was a failed launch. I should have produced teasers and
collaborated with a hunter, as I lacked an audience on the platform.


## The Design

My aim was to omit everything superfluous and show only the essential to the best possible advantage.
I wanted this to be clean, minimal. Heavily inspired by Notion.


<div className="grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-1 overflow-clip rounded-lg">

  />
</div>

The gradient that I used to fill the background was made by absolutely positioning a rough polygon
and overlaying a translucent div node over it.

I went through a lot of session replays and after crunching the numbers,
conclude that Clack lacked the audience. It could have made use of a better
launch. Users were curious as isevident by the 39 seconds
of average visit time on the landing page.

Anyways, time for the next one and a new and better product, and a fabulous launch!

**Keep building, keep learning. After all, there’s nothing that teaches like a project!**

> A launch is a in important milestone for YOU! It's the first step to start something great. 
If the launch didn't go well, no worries. At least you launched. Most people don't take action;
they merely consume. So give yourself a pat on the back.
