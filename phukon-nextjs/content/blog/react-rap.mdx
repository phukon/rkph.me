<Alert>
  Let me inform you beforehand that this song is a light take on the recent
  innovations in ReactJS ⚛. I do not, in any way, hate ReactJS. In fact, it
  is one of my favorite pieces of technology in modern times!

It was at around 1 am, I had just finished making my bed. I give my Twitter(X) feed one last scroll
and that's when I discover a trending tweet by a well known Twitter personality, it was kinda like Kanye's
interlude, and in his voice! He later linked the repo below.

This tweet quoted another tweet by a tech entreprenuer who actually wrote it. Me being me, I quicly capitalzed on the idea, opened up my Bandlab after 4 years and started cooking. Needless to say it came out pretty neat!✨

<Alert>
  Despite being a fan of Kanye's recent work, I frequently revisit his debut
  album, "The College Dropout," finding myself nostalgic for the old Kanye.{" "}

  <br />
  Kanye himself acknowledges this sentiment in his song "I Love Kanye,"
  prompting reflection on why many share a preference for the earlier phase of
  his career. The song has no instrumental, here give it a play.:
