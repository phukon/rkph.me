0650hrs 4 February 2024 It was a lovely dream. Bright day, golden hour. I was traveling
on the train. Seated in the lower berth, prolly tier 3. On my right sits this annoying
individual. I was on a phone call, it was prolly Dimi. The guy annoys me by leaning
close to listen to the conversation/my saying something mid call. I become angry
af and lash out.

I remember saying something like. "Mera next train northeast jane ka hai. Northeast chicks milenge" loudly with a grin.
The view outside is great. The landscape is glowing under the golden sun rays. I see streams, tea gardens, etc.

We then start talking about movies, now I'm starting to forget which as I'm writing about my dream now.

later it's time for us to deboard from the train. I become a bit nostalgic about the ride. I and the guy I lashed out at apologize to eaxh other. We hug and bis goodbyes.

I go the last seat on the train. The last seat is like a Tata Bus's laat seat. The kind that served as a school bus during my childhood days. Yk the dark green, long rectangular Tata buses.

Anyways we wait sitting on the last seat. The conductor is checking the tickets now (it's weird cuz we had stopped and were about to deboard).

THE HIGHLIGHT
This made me laugh so much. And I also wake up.

So the ticket is nothing but a chip. The eatable. The snack!! The potato chip is the ticket!

Turns out you have to open up your packet, and the conductor takes out a chip and eats it. That's him checkiyand verifying that I've been on the train by legal means.
He comes near me, I see the passengers infront swiftly tearing their packet of chips and the conductor taking on out and eating it. The conductor loves his job. ðŸ¤£
He comes to me, I tear my packet of potato chips. He takes one out, eats it with a loud crunch and then proceeds to check the ticket of the passenger on my right (whom I had a minor altercation with)

There was also a old lady. She also takes out a potato chip and then stands up bidding farewell to the fellow passengers and me.

Like I said, the train kinda transforms into the structure of a Tata bus at the end of the journey. So when I was leaving the train and I stand up, I see myself in the reflection on the glass behind the last seat.

I was a grown up man in the reflection. I had a goatee. Wearing a green polo (maybe). My lips were kinda big tho. I looked like Jordan Peele from the sketch comedy series Kay&Pelee. lol

Potato chips being legit tickets and the conductor eating it to verify passengers was so funny I wake up with a sight smile.

The dream was good man.. So funny.. It feels great now was I write about it lying on my bed, warm, under a thick and soft white blanket. I feel the cold winter air rushing in the room. It's cold, cold. Cold! The air stings my face.
