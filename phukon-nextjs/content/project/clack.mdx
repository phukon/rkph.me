Clack syncs your writing activity from Notion and Google Docs displaying progress on a calendar, just like GitHub's commit calendar! It also comes with an AI assistant and a Notion-style WYSIWYG editor.

This is my very first SaaS project! I built Clack in a month and with lots of attention to detail. The feel and style of Notion was a big inspiration.

At its core, Clack synchronizes seamlessly with your writing activities on Notion and Google Docs. You're also equipped with an AI assistant that will write alongside you to beat writer's block and a sleek, Notion-style WYSIWYG editor to bring your ideas to life effortlessly.

I wanted it to be fast therefore it uses ultra-low latency global KV store to read and write notes. Coupled with its sleek, minimalistic UI, Clack promises a delightful user experience from start to finish.
