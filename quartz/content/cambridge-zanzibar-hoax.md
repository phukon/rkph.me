**The Royal Deception: How a Group of Students Pulled Off the Ultimate Prank and Duped Their Mayor**

---

### 1905, Trinity College, Cambridge

The mastermind behind this prank was a student at Cambridge, Horace de Vere Cole. He was the origin of many pranks. He once dug a ditch in the middle of a busy street, got an MP arrested for theft (framed by Cole), and seated bald men together with letters written on their heads that spelt a cuss word.

Cole and his friend Adrian wanted to pull a big prank. So they decided to use the state visit of the Sultan of Zanzibar as the basis for their prank. They initially planned to fake a visit of the Sultan to their college but since the Sultanâ€™s picture had been in the newspapers recently, they then settled on impersonating the Sultanâ€™s uncle.

### Sultan of Zanzibar

On 2 March, they inquired the Mayor of Cambridge if he could arrange for the reception of a Sultan later that day. The following was what they wrote in the telegram:

*The Sultan of Zanzibar will arrive today at Cambridge at 4.27 for a short visit. Could you arrange to show him buildings of interest and send carriage?*  
*Henry Lucas, Hotel Cecil, London*

Cole and his friends played the Abyssinians by applying blackface. They arranged robes and turbans from a costumier in London. They arrived in Cambridge by taking a train from London. A carriage was sent to pick the group up from the Cambridge railway station and they were given a warm welcome by the mayor and town clerk.

They were then taken on a tour of the city, a local market, and even some parts of the university. Funnily enough, they even met some of their friends who did not recognize them at all. They demanded that they be dropped at the station after an hour.

### The Sprint Back Home

Unfortunately, the pranksters didnâ€™t have an exit plan. They didnâ€™t want to board a train to London only to return to Cambridge again as that would certainly mean breaking the 10 pm college curfew. But since they were surrounded by their well-wishers at that moment, they couldnâ€™t just refuse to board the train that had been arranged for them as that would raise suspicion.

So they just legged it! They lifted their skirts and sprinted away from the platform, hailed a taxi, which they then ordered to drive for all they were worth. They sought refuge at a friendâ€™s house, changed back to their normal attire, took a bath and had a nice meal before going back to their dorm rooms.

The Daily Mail wrote a story about some mysterious East African royals who after paying a state visit suddenly started speaking common English and sprinted away only to be never seen again. The following day, Cole himself gave an interview to the Daily Mail about the prank that left the mayor look like a fool. On 4 March, The Daily Mail published the story and by the next day, it had appeared in many newspapers.

Cole, however, ended up playing a more audacious practical joke on the Royal Navy 5 years later. Itâ€™s called the Dreadnought Hoax. You might want to google yourself. ðŸ˜‰
